We'll illustrate this with the following simple algorithm: given a integer N, compute the sum of all odd numbers minus the sum of all even numbers in $[0,N[$, that is (assuming N is even): compute $S=-0+1-2+...-(N-2)+(N-1)$.\n",

    "- Store the first column of your numpy array (the labels) into a variable y, then convert y to a numpy array of string using the 'numpy.ndarray.astype()' method.\n",
    "- Store the three next columns (the features) into a variable X (we choose to discard the last column since it is uninformative), then convert X to a numpy array of float using the 'numpy.ndarray.astype()' method. Finally, rescale all values in X by a factor of 1/255. \n",

    "\n",
    "4) How many different labels are there in the dataset ? What is the number of samples for each label ? Hint: you can use the 'numpy.unique()' function, with the 'return_counts' flag set to True.\n",

    "5) Let us investigate further the dataset: for each label in the dataset, extract from X the features of all samples with this label, then compute the mean value of those features with respect to the samples (we have three features so you should end up with a mean vector of size 3). Hint: to extract the rows of a matrix X for which a certain boolean condition is True, you would write '$X[cond,:]$' where cond is a boolean vector whose size is the number of rows in X. In order to compute the mean vector of a matrix X along a given dimension d, you would write 'numpy.mean(X, axis=d)' (d=0 to compute the mean wrt rows, d=1 to compute the mean wrt columns). Do the mean vectors look consistent for each label ?\n",
    "\n",
    "6) It is often crucial in machine learning that the data is properly shuffled in order to learn good models. Therefore, it is usually recommended to shuffle the data as a preprocessing step, even if the data appears to be shuffled already. Shuffle your numpy arrays X and y (they must be shuffled by the same permutation !). Hint: You can build a permutation using the functions 'numpy.random.shuffle()' and 'numpy.arange()'."

    "# Exercise 6: Basics of object-oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a language that fully supports object-oriented programming (OOP). This paradigm is a different way of thinking, organizing and writing your code. Although OOP is not \"essential\" in machine learning, in some cases it may let us implement non-trivial machine learning algorithms (e.g. decision trees) in a rather intuitive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind OOP is to think your code as a hierachy of concepts. For instance, if one wishes to make a naval video game, a very broad concept could be \"Naval ship\". This concept could be divided into subconcepts, like \"Submarine\" and \"Boat\" which are two different types of naval ship: though different, they still share some similarities (they are made to be used in the sea, they carry a crew...). \n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts form what we call \"classes\" in OOP. Objects are instances of a class: you can understand this as the class being the abstraction of an object. As such, in OOP most of the implementation goes into writing a hierarchy of classes. A class consists of two main ingredients: attributes and methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we could implement a class \"Submarine\" with the attributes 'submerged', 'current_depth', 'max_depth', 'condition', 'size_crew', 'current_position' and with the methods 'go_underwater()', 'reach_surface()' and 'navigate()'. In this example, the role of attributes and methods becomes obvious: attributes are inherent characteristics of the objects abstracted by the class while methods are functions representing the actions objects of the class will be able to perform. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the attributes 'condition', 'size_crew', 'current_position' and the method 'navigate()' are non-specific to submarines but concern all kinds of naval ship, they can be implemented as part of a larger class \"NavalShip\". Then, by having our \"Submarine\" class \"inherit\" from the larger \"NavalShip\" class, our submarines will also have access to attributes and methods of naval ships.\n",
